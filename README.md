### CPP_STL

## What is this repo?

Well, I am learning CPP and now starting off with STL. But comically, I am already working with CPP as an embedded engineer and currently base my learning form the pre-written code and since I am pretty experienced with programming in general it works.

However, I want to actually learn this beautiful language much more detail. Hence this repo will conatin ABSOLUTELY non-sense code which are all a part of the learning journey.

If this helps anyone I would be pleasantly surprised! ;-)
